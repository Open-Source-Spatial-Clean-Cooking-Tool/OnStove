    "# OnStove notebook\n",
    "This is the OnStove notebook. The purpose of the notebook is to give users the ability to run through the analysis with example data and it can therefore act as a complement to the [scientific publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-01039-8) and [read-the-docs documentation](https://onstove-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is divided into 4 major parts: \n",
    "1. [**Data processing**](#1.-Data-processing) - In this part of the analysis different geospatial datasets are read and processed (reprojecting, cliping, masking, aligning, resampling, etc.). The datasets from this step are saved on the users computer. For future runs on the same area of interest this step can consequently be skipped unless datasets are switched. \n",
    "1. [**Calibration**](#2.-Calibration) - In this part, the area of interest is calibrated. Raster cells are classified as either urban or rural, the electrification rate in different cells is determined and the rates of different cooking fuels across settlements are calibrated. The calibrated data is saved in a `.pkl-file`. Unless data related to these steps are changed from one run to another, this step only needs to be ran once. \n",
    "1. [**Model run**](#3.-Model-run) - The net-benefit for different stoves is determined in different parts of the study area. Once all stoves have a net-benefit calculated the stoves will be compared and the stove with the highest net-benefit in each settlement is selected. Summaries of the results documenting the benefits and costs of each stove type across the entire study area are produced. The results are saved as a `.pkl-file`.  \n",
    "1. [**Visualization**](#4.-Visualization) - Visualizing and saving different maps related to the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each part of the notebook is divided into several different cells and each cell is described more in depth. \n",
